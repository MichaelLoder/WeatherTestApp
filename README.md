# Weather Test

4Com technical test for prospective .NET developers.

## Improvements

The project could be improved in a number of ways, some improvements i would suggest are

1) Error checking - most important
2) A lot more unit test / Integration test 
3) A better rule engine, that can handle a collection of rules
4) Static links need to be stored correctly, database, web.config depending how often these links are to changed
5) Better error handling on the front end
6) Better UI, i would of liked to use something like Angularjs and display more information

## Adding more api's

The WeatherAggergatorFactory's switch statement can be extending to allow for more Temperature Units and WindSpeed units.

## Unit Test

Currently there are only 6 unit tests, all tests pass. 



I've also added a random thread sleep to the api calls that emulate a slow response
